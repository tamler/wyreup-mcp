Project Brief: WyreUP MCP Adapter

Document Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2025-05-23
Project Lead/Contact: Project Lead

0 | Purpose

Enable anyone to expose and control their automation workflows (e.g. n8n, Make.com, flowiseai.com, etc) as agent-callable tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system should support both local self-hosted usage and optional cloud-hosted proxy/distribution by WyreUP.

‚∏ª

1 | Target Users
	‚Ä¢	Automation Users: Individuals running workflows on n8n or Make.com who want to connect them to LLM agents.
	‚Ä¢	Developers: Those who want to wrap automation in agent-accessible services.
	‚Ä¢	Teams: Organizations who want centralized management of agent tools with secure key handling and proxying.

‚∏ª

2 | Key Features

Local MCP Server (default)
	‚Ä¢	Installable via npx wyreup-mcp
	‚Ä¢	Reads from a wyreup.json manifest file
	‚Ä¢	Exposes local MCP server with endpoints like http://localhost:3333/tools/{tool}
	‚Ä¢	No key sharing or external exposure
	‚Ä¢	Unlimited tools per user
	‚Ä¢	Auth is handled by the underlying webhook tool (e.g., n8n supports Basic, Header, and JWT auth)

Hosted MCP Proxy (optional)
	‚Ä¢	WyreUP hosts tool.json manifests at https://wyreup.com/tools/{username}/{tool}
	‚Ä¢	Proxy-based relay mode for key injection and secured automation workflows
	‚Ä¢	Public or private tools (via auth tokens)
	‚Ä¢	Supports paid add-ons via CLI flags and API key authentication

wyreup.json Manifest Format
	‚Ä¢	Simple declarative JSON file describing each automation as a tool
	‚Ä¢	Includes tool name, description, input/output schema, and webhook endpoint
	‚Ä¢	Supports variable interpolation (e.g., $API_KEY)

‚∏ª

3 | Tool Naming & Discovery

CLI Naming
	‚Ä¢	Single package: npx wyreup-mcp
	‚Ä¢	Invoked with flags like --config, --serve, --publish, --proxy-mode, --team, --secure-auth

URL Structure
	‚Ä¢	Local: http://localhost:3333/tools/{tool}
	‚Ä¢	Hosted: https://wyreup.com/tools/{username}/{tool}
	‚Ä¢	Follows MCP spec as closely as possible for compatibility

‚∏ª

4 | Security Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Local use: All keys and endpoints remain private to user
	‚Ä¢	Hosted use:
	‚Ä¢	Environment-variable-based secrets (e.g., $API_KEY)
	‚Ä¢	Token-based access control for private tools (optional, only for hosted tools)
	‚Ä¢	Proxy injection only; never store user secrets directly
	‚Ä¢	Authentication is free and handled natively by platforms like n8n

‚∏ª

5 | Strategic Goals
	‚Ä¢	Simplify MCP tooling for everyday automation users
	‚Ä¢	Enable agent-app interoperability with no-code platforms
	‚Ä¢	Lay groundwork for a tool registry and proxy service with monetization potential
	‚Ä¢	Preserve compatibility with MCP standards for tool discovery and agent support

‚∏ª

6 | Monetization Plan (Paid CLI Flags)
	‚Ä¢	--publish: Upload tools to WyreUP cloud MCP registry
	‚Ä¢	--proxy-mode: Enable secure key injection proxying
	‚Ä¢	--team=org: Enable multi-user/team management
	‚Ä¢	--secure-auth: Add WyreUP-managed token-auth endpoints (optional)

Note: Authentication is free and handled natively by platforms like n8n.

‚∏ª

7 | Public Registry and Marketplace Support
	‚Ä¢	Tools can be published as ‚Äúpublic‚Äù to allow free use and sharing
	‚Ä¢	Public tools are listed on wyreup.com/tools/explore or equivalent UI
	‚Ä¢	Marketplace for selling automations is a planned future phase:
	‚Ä¢	Users can offer tools as paid services
	‚Ä¢	WyreUP may act as secure broker via proxy/token mechanisms
	‚Ä¢	Support for usage metering, billing, and key management under premium plans
